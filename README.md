# RB3DOverlayed!

A hunt-oriented version of RebornBuddy's 3d Overlay plugin

------

## What is this?

For a while now, RebornBuddy ships with a plugin called 3d Overlay. Once you activate it, an overlay will be drawn over the game window to display informations like units and gameobjects.

This modified version focuses on removing some of the useless remnants from it's HonorBuddy origin and adds some handy tools for people to find their hunt mobs.

RB3DOverlayed! will list all nearby S-, A- and B-mobs.

## How to use

Install the plugin to `.\RebornBuddy\Plugins\RB3DOverlayed`.

Please make sure you start RebornBuddy **as administrator** to ensure the hooking works correctly. If started without administrator rights, the plugin will not overlay the game client correctly.
